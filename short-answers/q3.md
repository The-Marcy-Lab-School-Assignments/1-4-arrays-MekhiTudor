# Question
Check out [the docs for the rest operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters) for this question.

What's the difference between the spread operator and the rest operator?

# Answer
The `rest` parameter condenses down an indefinite number of arguments into an array while, on the other hand, the `spread` operator copies all objects in one array to be used in a new one. The difference is in their use-case.
