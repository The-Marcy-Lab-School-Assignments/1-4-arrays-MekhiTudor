# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer
In the second function, `Boston` is being added to the `favoriteLocations` array which is a non-primitive data-type. While in the first function they are trying to destructure a primitive data type.

Hey! You are close! Your instinct to talk about primitive vs non-primitive data types is correct. From there you could have either connected it to mutability and/or pass by reference vs. pass by value! Which is the actual reason why `favoriteLocations` was changed but `name` was not.
